Static memory allocation is suitable when the memory requirements are known in advance and fixed throughout the program execution. Static memory allocation is usually done for `global` and `static variables`, and for the `code segment`.\n",

Dynamic memory allocation is useful when the memory requirements are variable or need to be determined at run time. Dynamic memory allocation is usually done for `local variables`, and for the `heap segment`.\n",

The `malloc` function returns a pointer to the allocated memory, which you can use to access and modify the array elements. You can also use the `free` function to deallocate the memory when you no longer need the array, and free up the memory for other uses."

    "In Python, memory allocation is handled by the interpreter via **garbage collection** and **reference counting** to manage the memory on the heap. However, you can still use some techniques to achieve static and dynamic memory allocation in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Static memory allocation** in Python can be achieved by using **immutable objects**, such as `strings`, `tuples`, and `frozensets`. Immutable objects are objects whose values cannot be changed once they are created. Python optimizes memory usage by reusing immutable objects as much as possible. For example, if you create two strings with the same value, they will both refer to the same object in memory, and use less memory.\n",
    "    * For example, if you write `x = \"Hello\"` and `y = \"Hello\"`, both `x` and `y` will point to the same string object in memory, which has a fixed size and location. This object will be allocated at compile time, and cannot be modified or deallocated at run time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dynamic memory allocation** in Python can be achieved by using `mutable objects`, such as `lists`, `dictionaries`, and `sets`. Mutable objects are objects whose values can be changed after they are created. Python allocates memory for mutable objects on the heap, and allows the programmer to modify and delete them at run time. For example, if you create a list and append or remove elements from it, the size and location of the list object in memory will change accordingly.\n",
    "    * For example, in Python, if you write `x = [1, 2, 3]` and `y = x`, both `x` and `y` will point to the same list object in memory, which has a variable size and location. This object will be allocated at run time, and can be modified or deallocated at run time. If you write `x.append(4)`, the list object will grow in size and may change its location in memory. If you write `del x`, the list object will be deallocated from memory, and `y` will point to a non-existent object.\n",
    " \n",
    "* A **memory leak** is a situation where some memory that is no longer needed by the program is `not freed` or `reclaimed` by the system. This can cause the program to use more and more memory over time, and eventually run out of memory or slow down the system."
