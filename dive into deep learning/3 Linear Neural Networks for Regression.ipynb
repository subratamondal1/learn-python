    "Regression problems pop up whenever we want to predict a numerical value. Common examples include predicting prices (of homes, stocks, etc.), predicting the length of stay (for patients in the hospital), forecasting demand (for retail sales), among numerous others. Not every prediction problem is one of classical regression. Later on, we will introduce classification problems, where the goal is to predict membership among a set of categories.\n",

To develop a model for predicting house prices, we need to get our hands on data, including the sales price, area, and age for each home. In the terminology of machine learning, the dataset is called a **training dataset** or **training set**, and each row (containing the data corresponding to one sale) is called an **example** (or data point, instance, sample). The thing we are trying to predict (price) is called a **label** (or **target**). The variables (age and area) upon which the predictions are based are called **features** (or **covariates**)."

    "\n",
    "The image you've provided illustrates the Minibatch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm. Let’s break down the formula and explain how it works step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(\\mathbf{w}, b) \\leftarrow (\\mathbf{w}, b) - \\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}_t|} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{B}_t} \\nabla_{(\\mathbf{w}, b)} \\ell^{(i)} (\\mathbf{w}, b)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to Pronounce/Read the Formula in Natural Language:\n",
    "- The pair of parameters $$(\\mathbf{w}, b)$$ is updated to a new value.\n",
    "- This update is performed by subtracting a quantity from the current values of $$(\\mathbf{w}, b)$$.\n",
    "- The quantity to subtract is the product of the learning rate $$\\eta$$ divided by the size of the minibatch $$|\\mathcal{B}_t|$$, and the average of the gradients of the loss function $$\\ell^{(i)}$$ with respect to the parameters $$(\\mathbf{w}, b)$$ for all samples in the minibatch $$\\mathcal{B}_t$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How the Formula is Working:\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: \n",
    "   - Before the iteration starts, the model parameters $$\\mathbf{w}$$ (weights) and $$b$$ (bias) are initialized. They can be initialized randomly or using other techniques.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Minibatch Sampling**:\n",
    "   - At each iteration $$t$$, a minibatch $$\\mathcal{B}_t$$ of training examples is randomly sampled from the training data. The minibatch $$\\mathcal{B}_t$$ contains a fixed number of examples, denoted by $$|\\mathcal{B}_t|$$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Compute Gradients**:\n",
    "   - For each example $$i$$ in the minibatch $$\\mathcal{B}_t$$, compute the gradient of the loss function $$\\ell^{(i)}$$ with respect to the model parameters $$\\mathbf{w}$$ and $$b$$. The gradient $$\\nabla_{(\\mathbf{w},b)} \\ell^{(i)}(\\mathbf{w}, b)$$ tells us the direction in which the loss increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Average the Gradients**:\n",
    "   - The gradients for all examples in the minibatch are averaged. This averaging is done by summing up the individual gradients and dividing by the number of examples in the minibatch $$|\\mathcal{B}_t|$$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Update the Parameters**:\n",
    "   - The parameters $$\\mathbf{w}$$ and $$b$$ are updated by moving them in the direction opposite to the averaged gradient. The amount by which we move is controlled by the learning rate $$\\eta$$. The learning rate is a small positive number that determines the step size for each update.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. **Repeat**:\n",
    "   - This process is repeated for many iterations, sampling a new minibatch $$\\mathcal{B}_t$$ each time, until the algorithm converges (i.e., the loss function stops decreasing significantly).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Each Part is Doing:\n",
    "- **$$\\mathbf{w}$$ and $$b$$**: These are the parameters (weights and biases) of your model that you're trying to optimize.\n",
    "- **$$\\eta$$ (eta)**: This is the learning rate, a small positive scalar that controls the size of the step we take in the direction of the negative gradient.\n",
    "- **$$|\\mathcal{B}_t|$$**: This denotes the size of the minibatch $$\\mathcal{B}_t$$, i.e., the number of training examples in the minibatch.\n",
    "- **$$\\nabla_{(\\mathbf{w},b)} \\ell^{(i)}(\\mathbf{w}, b)$$**: This is the gradient of the loss function $$\\ell^{(i)}$$ with respect to the parameters $$(\\mathbf{w}, b)$$ for a single training example $$i$$. It tells us how much the loss will change if we slightly change the parameters $$(\\mathbf{w}, b)$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Closed-Form Expansion:\n",
    "The closed-form expansion provided is specific to quadratic loss functions and affine transformations. It shows how the weight vector $$\\mathbf{w}$$ and bias $$b$$ are updated using the input features $$\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$$ and the actual output $$y^{(i)}$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This expansion explains the specific update rules for weights and bias:\n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{w} \\leftarrow \\mathbf{w} - \\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}_t|} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{B}_t} \\mathbf{x}^{(i)} \\left(\\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b - y^{(i)}\\right)\n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "$$$$\n",
