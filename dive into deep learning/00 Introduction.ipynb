    "**Unsupervised** and **self-supervised learning** represent areas of machine learning **where models learn from data without explicit labels** unlike supervised learning, where models are trained with labeled datasets. This approach is akin to working with a vague directive, where the data scientist must creatively determine the questions to ask and the insights to derive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised Learning** focuses on tasks such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clustering**: Grouping data into categories, like sorting photos into landscapes, animals, and people, or categorizing users based on browsing behavior.\n",
    "- **Subspace Estimation / Dimensionality Reduction**: Identifying a small set of parameters that capture essential data characteristics, such as using principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality.\n",
    "- **Representation in Euclidean Space**: Mapping complex objects and their relationships into a space where symbolic properties are well-matched.\n",
    "- **Causality and Probabilistic Models**: Understanding the root causes and relationships within data, such as analyzing demographic factors affecting house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant advancement in unsupervised learning is **deep generative models**, which **estimate data density** and **generate new data** samples. Notable models include **variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, normalizing flows,** and **diffusion models**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-Supervised Learning** leverages unlabeled data to create supervisory signals. In text, models can **predict masked words using context**, while in images, models might learn by predicting the relative position of image parts or identifying perturbed versions of the same image. These techniques often produce robust representations that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, enhancing their applicability in various domains."

    "Interacting with an environment introduces a dynamic aspect to machine learning that goes beyond the static nature of offline learning. In traditional supervised and unsupervised learning, models are trained on pre-collected datasets without further interaction with the environment. This approach, known as **offline learning**, allows for isolated pattern recognition but limits the capability to develop intelligent agents that can act and adapt in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create truly intelligent agents, we need to consider how actions impact the environment and future observations. This involves addressing several key questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does the environment remember what we did previously?\n",
    "- Does the environment want to help us, e.g., a user reading text into a speech recognizer?\n",
    "- Does the environment want to beat us, e.g., spammers adapting their emails to evade spam filters?\n",
    "- Does the environment have shifting dynamics? For example, would future data always resemble the past or would the patterns change over time, either naturally or in response to our automated tools?\n",
    "\n",
    "These considerations lead to the concept of **distribution shift**, where the data encountered during deployment differs from the training data. This is akin to facing different exam questions than those practiced in homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement learning** provides a framework for addressing these challenges by allowing an agent to learn through interaction with the environment. The **agent makes decisions, receives feedback,** and **adjusts its actions** to maximize long-term rewards, making it well-suited for scenarios where actions directly impact future states and observations. This approach is essential for developing adaptive, intelligent systems capable of operating effectively in dynamic and complex environments."

    "**Reinforcement learning (RL)** is a machine learning paradigm focused on **developing agents** that interact with environments to make decisions and take actions. It is particularly useful in applications such as robotics, dialogue systems, and AI for video games. **Deep reinforcement learning**, which combines deep learning with RL, has gained prominence with achievements like the **deep Q-network** surpassing humans in Atari games and AlphaGo defeating the world champion in Go.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RL, an agent interacts with an environment over time, receiving observations and selecting actions that influence the environment. The agent receives rewards based on its actions, and its behavior is guided by a policyâ€”a function mapping observations to actions. The primary goal is to develop policies that maximize long-term rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "RL is versatile and can be applied to problems beyond the scope of supervised learning. Unlike supervised learning, where inputs come with correct labels, RL does not assume optimal actions for each observation. Instead, agents receive rewards, which may not directly indicate which actions led to success, presenting the credit assignment problem. For example, in chess, the reward comes only at the game's end, requiring the agent to determine which moves contributed to winning or losing.\n",
    "\n",
    "RL also addresses partial observability, where current observations might not fully reveal the agent's state. For instance, a cleaning robot trapped in a closet must infer its location based on previous observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key challenge in RL is balancing exploration and exploitation. An agent must decide whether to exploit known strategies for immediate rewards or explore new strategies that might yield better long-term outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RL framework encompasses various problem settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**: When the environment is fully observable.\n",
    "- **Contextual Bandit Problems**: When the state does not depend on previous actions.\n",
    "- **Multi-Armed Bandit Problems**: When there is no state, just a set of actions with unknown rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "These specialized cases help researchers tackle RL problems with varying levels of complexity, making RL a versatile and widely applicable approach in machine learning."
